    "## CS328 Assignment 3: Human Activity Recognition Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to develop your understanding and practical application skills in the field of machine learning, particularly focusing on Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Human Activity Recognition has become increasingly important in various fields including health care, personal fitness, smart homes, and surveillance. In this assignment, you will be working with a dataset collected from a wrist-worn device, which includes accelerometer data. The data has been classified into nine distinct activities: downstairs, jogging, lying, sitting, standing, upstairs, walking fast, walking moderate, and walking slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get hands-on experience in several key aspects of machine learning and data processing:\n",
    "1. Data collection and preprocessing from multiple sources for analysis\n",
    "2. Understand how to create windows of raw data through resampling and to extract meaningful features from these windows.\n",
    "3. Hands-on experience on how to extract features, encode target variables, split datasets, train models, make predictions, and evaluate the performance of these models.\n",
    "4. Learn to assess your trained modelâ€™s performance using common metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix and more. Understanding how well your models are performing is crucial in any machine learning task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this assignment, you will be able to develop a pipeline for Human Activity Recognition that can be further fine-tuned for different tasks or datasets. You will be able to apply the skills and knowledge gained here to other machine learning projects and real-world applications.\n"

    "## Assignment: Testing Classifier Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will evaluate the overall performance of our activity classifier using a combined dataset of all activities. This process helps understand how accurately the model can classify a wide variety of activities. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Generation**: We start by calling the `all_data_to_combined_csv()` function. This function processes all the individual activity datasets, applies the necessary preprocessing, and generates a combined CSV file named 'all_data.csv'. Note that the function only creates this file once, so if you need to recreate it with updated preprocessing or feature extraction, you should delete the existing file first.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Loading**: Once we have the combined CSV file, we load it into a pandas DataFrame for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activity Selection**: Next, we choose a subset of activities to exclude from the dataset. We do this by listing them in the `drop_activities` array. The remaining activities will be the ones our decision tree model tries to classify. You can experiment with different subsets of activities to see how it impacts the model's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Training**: The `train_decision_tree` function is then called with the chosen classes. This function trains the decision tree model and evaluates its performance, printing the precision, recall, and accuracy metrics. It also returns the trained model, the confusion matrix, and the overall accuracy for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Performance Visualization**: To provide a visual understanding of the model's performance, we display the confusion matrix using matplotlib's `ConfusionMatrixDisplay` function. Each row of the matrix corresponds to a true class, while each column corresponds to a predicted class. The diagonal elements represent correctly classified instances, and off-diagonal elements are instances that are misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Decision Tree Visualization**: Finally, we visualize the decision tree using the `viz_tree` function. This function generates a graphic representation of the decision tree model, showing how it makes decisions based on the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section's output can help understand how well the model generalizes to different activities and how different features influence the model's decisions. Remember that it's normal if the model performs better on some activities than others, depending on the complexity and distinctiveness of the activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provided an example of how to evaluate the model on your own data, feel free to modify it.\n"

    "# Part 2: Experimenting with Different Activity Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we want you to experiment with different combinations of activities and observe the impact on the decision tree model's accuracy. Understanding how varying the activities impacts the model's performance can provide valuable insight into the distinctiveness of the movements and their complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Three Types of Walking**: To do this, modify the `activities` list to only include 'walk_fast', 'walk_mod', and 'walk_slow'. Run the training code and note the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stairs Activities**: Next, modify the `activities` list to only include 'upstairs' and 'downstairs'. Run the training code and note the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Static Activities**: For this run, modify the `activities` list to only include 'lying', 'sitting', and 'standing'. Run the training code and note the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mobile Activities**: Now, consider all the activities involving movement i.e. exclude 'lying', 'sitting', and 'standing' in the `activities` list. Run the training code and note the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **All Activities**: Finally, all activities are included in the training process. Run the training code and note the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each experiment, set the depth of the decision tree to 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What To Report\n",
    "For each of the above combinations,\n",
    "- **Fill up** this table based on the results you obtain by trying different parameters (only modify the first line). We will evaluate the accuracy of numbers you fill up below.\n",
    "- **Interpretation of the results**: What do these accuracy scores suggest about the ability of the model to distinguish between these activities? Do some activities appear to be more distinguishable than others? How do different combinations of activities affect the accuracy? Remember to provide a brief discussion for each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rubrics:**\n",
    "Part 2:\n",
    "Function 3: 50% - Each combination - 10%\n",
    "1. Accuracy, precision, recall Table Filled up\n",
    "2. Accuracy, precision, recall for your collected data Fill up\n",
    "3. Interpretation of the results\n",
    "4. Compare the obtained results in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy, and provide your interpretation of these results. For example, if your precision is lower than accuracy, why do you think that is the case? Or if your recall is higher than precision, what might that indicate based on your experience, and so on.\n",

    "Hint: You can use the confusion_matrix to get precision, recall"
